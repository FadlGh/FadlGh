I have a keen interest in game development and enjoy creating immersive experiences. Whether it's designing game mechanics, developing game logic, or working on interactive graphics, I love the creative process of building games.

Python is my go-to language for automation, tools, data visualisation, and other fun programming projects. I love using this high-level programming language.
